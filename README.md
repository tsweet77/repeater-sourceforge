The Intention Repeater MAX bundle has been 4+ years in the making. It was written by Thomas Sweet aka Anthro Teacher (AnthroHeart).

The suite of Intention Repeater MAX programs are powered by a Servitor, which is programmed intelligent energy.
For information on what a Servitor is see: https://enlightenedstates.com/servitor-just-powerful-spiritual-tool/

Utilizing intention multiplying, compression and hashing of intentions allows equivalent speeds of 10+ EHz for MAX and 1+ YHz for CUDA.
If you have an Nvidia CUDA-capable GPU, then CUDA is the way to go if you have Linux or Windows.

Note: I was unable to get the GUI for MAX to work for macOS.

For Multi-Format to WAV Repeater, the higher the Smoothing percent you choose, the more like a pure sine wave it will be.
5% Smoothing is a good starting point. If you do 0% Volume, it will create a silent WAV, which still has power because of the Servitor.
If you're converting Text, choose Text to WAV sampling option. Unless the file size is too big.
Text to WAV is smoother, and provides more gradual playing of the characters of your input file/intention.
Binary to WAV is useful for converting images, where you want it to repeat as fast as possible so you can get the full image more at once
when playing back the WAV. It will sound a bit more noisy, but with smoothing, it sounds decent.
